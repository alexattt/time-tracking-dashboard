# Frontend Mentor challenge - Time tracking dashboard

<p>
  My version of Time tracking dashboard for Frontend mentor challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/time-tracking-dashboard-UIQ7167Jw).
</p>
<p>I used React for Frontendmentor challenge for the first time. I decided to stick to good, old scss for styling, used grid.</p>
